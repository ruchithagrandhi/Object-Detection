# Object-Detection
The Object Detection project, developed under AIMERS APSCHE, uses a camera and a custom-trained model to detect strawberries in real-time. Leveraging a strawberry dataset, it processes images or video to identify and locate strawberries, offering hands-on experience in computer vision and machine learning for educational purposes.
